To speed up development, we've moved exchange into a workspace in the `goose` [repo]. 

Exchange will remain available as a standalone package at [`ai-exchange`][pypi]

[repo]: https://github.com/block-open-source/goose/tree/main/packages/exchange
[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/ai-exchange/#description
